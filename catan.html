          So you want to beat your friends in Catan? The Settlers of Catan is a
          game of luck and strategy, although no promises that this post will

          First, a brief reminder of the game
        </p>
        <p class="catan__container__text">
          The goal of the game is to gain 10 victory points by building
          settlements, cities, roads, and obtaining development cards. To do all
          this you will need resources, which are gained according to what
          numbers are rolled on the dice each round and where your settlements
          are located.

          Although you may find success going for a balanced approach, this may
          not be the most effective path to victory. Here's some more
          specialised approaches you can utilise to guide your gameplay.
          <br /><br />
          Wood ü™µ and brick üß±. This approach focuses on building roads and
          settlements. This approach is good if you have a lot of wood and brick
          early on to fuel rapid expansion. This expansion not only sets you up
          for the longest road but can also cut off opportunities for other
          player.
          <br /><br />
          Ore ü™® and wheat üåæ. This approach focuses on building cities and
          buying development card. This approach is good if you have a lot of
          ore and wheat early on to upgrade your settlements to cities and
          obtain more resources. Ore and wheat are also good for buying
          development cards, which can be used to gain resources, build roads,
          or gain victory points.
          <br /><br />
          Monopoly üé©. This approach focuses on monopolizing a resource. This is
          not the easiest to pull off, but if you can get a monopoly on a
          resource, you can use it to your advantage in trades. Brick and ore
          are usually the best resources to monopolize, as there are 3 tiles
          each.
          <br /><br />
          Port üõ•Ô∏è. This approach focuses on getting access to 2 for 1 ports and
          trading with the bank. For this to work, you need settlements or
          cities that give you the corresponding resource for 2 for 1 ports that
          are accesible to you.

        <p class="catan__container__subheading">Initial Settlements</p>
        <p class="catan__container__text">
          As you may have seen, the approaches above all require certain
          resources and board states to be effective. This means that you should
          be careful about where you place your initial settlements. Here are
          some things to consider.
          <br /><br />
          Consider the rarity of resources on the board, you should determine
          which overall approach you want to take and choose settlement
          positions which allow you to act on it right away. The total of the
          values of tiles at the intersections and the total of the values of
          particular resources on the board is a good way to figure out an
          overall approach.
          <br /><br />
          If you require resource B, sometimes it might be better to settle at a
          high number tile for resource A and trade 4 to 1 at ports for resource
          B, than getting the lower number resource B tile.
          <br /><br />
          It is also important to have a diverse range of tile numbers so you
          don't go on long dry spells.
        </p>

        <p class="catan__container__subheading">Development Cards</p>
        <img

        <p class="catan__container__text">
          The Monopoly card allows the player to steal all of any one resource
          from all other players. It is the most fun card to use, but also the
          hardest to use correctly. To make the most of it, you should try to be
          aware of resources other players pocess so you can maximise the amount
          of resources you steal.
          <br /><br />
          Alternatively, you can trade away a resource you have plenty of and
          then take it all back with the monolopy card. PS. Use wisely as it
          might make trading with other players for rest of the game much harder
          üôÇ.
